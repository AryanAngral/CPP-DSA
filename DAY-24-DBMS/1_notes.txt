PL/SQL (Procedural Language / Strictured Query Language):
    PL/SQL is Oracle's procedural extension for SQL.
    It lets you write code blocks that include: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE statements, and control structures like loops and conditionals.
    PL/SQL code blocks can be anonymous or named (stored procedures, functions, packages).

    - You can write procedures, functions and triggers.
    - You can handle errors.
    - You can reuse code.
    - You can use conditional logic and loops.

    Basic code / Synatx:
        DECLARE
            -- Declare variables
        BEGIN
            -- WRITE SQL LOGIC OR STATEMENT HERE.
        END;
        /
